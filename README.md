Just a python project in HSE.
## Features:
* buy/sell/buy short/sell short stock for the latest price on IEX stock exchange aka real broker.
* Compete with your friends for the title of the most successful(lucky) one.
* See rankings of challanges you are in.
* Search for companies' symbols and then see the latest price of the stock
* See the stats of your portfolio.
* Create multiple portfolios. Just so you can devide your portfolios by the risk level.
## Maybe not working:
I'm not sure that it's how the project supposed to be commited (i didn't add python and libraries to the project, so it might not work right away, but it's easy to fix)
